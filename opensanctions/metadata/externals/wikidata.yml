summary: |
  Wikidata is the structured data project of the Wikipedia community,
  providing fact-based information edited by humans and machines.
description: |
  Wikidata serves as the source of much of the OpenSanctions data related to
  politically exposed persons (PEPs). We also link up entities that are 
  sanctioned whenever a relevant Wikidata item is available.

  The Wikidata importer will also traverse family and personal relationships
  that are documented in the database and import relatives and close associates
  whereever these are stated.

  ### Limitations

  There is no attempt to link companies and organizations from sanctions lists
  to Wikidata, as the way that an encyclopedia describes such legal entities is
  not granular enough for due diligence use cases.

  We also remove any person born before 1900, or who has died before 2000 from
  the dataset in order to avoid outdated profiles that could lead to false
  positives.

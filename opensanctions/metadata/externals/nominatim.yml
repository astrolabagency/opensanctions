title: OpenStreetMap Nominatim Geocoder
summary: |
  Nominatim is a geocoding system based on OpenStreetMap, the open map of the
  world created by a community of mappers.
description: |
  We're using Nominatim to disambiguate the addresses linked to sanctions targets
  in OpenSanctions in order to create fewer and cleaner entries for addresses. To 
  achieve this, we're using reverse geocoding - a process in which an address 
  written in human-readable form is associated with a specific place (OSM node)
  in the database.

  Currently, the imported data does not include latitude/longitude coordinates in
  order to avoid a false sense of precision. Lat/lons can be provided upon demand.

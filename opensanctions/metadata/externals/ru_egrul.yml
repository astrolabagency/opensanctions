title: Russian Unified State Register of Legal Entities (EGRUL)
summary: |
  Companies database of the Russian Federation as maintained and published by 
  the Federal Tax Service.
description: |
  The tax database of legal entities is probably the most detailed part of the 
  companies registry (other fragments are maintained by the statistics body and
  others). The registry data must be purchased from the tax authority, but a
  full version of it has been released online by a Russian IT entrepreneur.

  This snapshot is dated 2022-01-01, in order to meet a compromise between using
  fresh data, and avoiding information loss via intra-war data removals.

  The beneficial ownership database of legal entities registered in Ukraine (EDR)

  Publication of this data has been suspended since the Russian attack on Feburary
  24, 2022. We're not linking to the full dataset here, either, but instead include
  details on those Ukrainian companies identified by the Ukraine National Security
  Council on its sanctions list. 

  > Beneficial ownership data in Ukraine has been publicly available as
  > open data in the Unified State Register of Legal Entities and
  > Individual Entrepreneurs (USR) since 2017.

  > Ukrainian law refers to ‘controllers’ (контролери) as opposed to
  > ‘founders’ (засновниками) to differentiate beneficial ownership from
  > legal ownership/shareholding. ‘Founders’ can be legal entities or
  > natural persons.

  > A beneficial owner of a legal entity is a natural person who directly
  > or indirectly:

  > * Has the right to execute decisive influence on the management or
  >   economic activity of a legal entity
  > * Has decisive influence on the composition and decisions of the entity’s managing body
  > * Has at least 25% of shares or voting rights of the entity
  > * Nominees and agents of such rights cannot be named as beneficial owners.

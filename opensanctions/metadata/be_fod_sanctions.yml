  Financial sanctions are restrictive measures that are taken in respect of countries,
  individuals or entities with the aim of putting an end to breaches of international
  peace and security such as terrorism, human rights violations, the destabilisation
  of sovereign states and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

  These financial sanctions generally form part of a more comprehensive sanctions
  regime that also contains other restrictive measures, such as embargos on exports
  or imports of certain products (e.g. weapons, oil and technologies) or restrictions
  in terms of travel and visas.

  Financial sanctions include:

  * freezing measures
  * bans on investment, loans or insurance in certain sectors
  * financing the import or export of specific goodsâ€¦
collections:
  - sanctions
